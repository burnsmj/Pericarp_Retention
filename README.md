# Pericarp Retention Analysis

## Background
Purpose: Developing methods for researchers to assess the quantity of pericarp retained after the nixtamalization process.

Initial Direction: Develop a computer vision or image analysis model to assess the quantity of stained pericarp present on kernels after a rapid cook (defined in Serna-Saldivar et. al. 1991).

Current Direction: Develop a machine learning model to predict pericarp retention of samples based on their near infrared spectra.

## Directories
Image Analysis
 - Code developed to assess images of stained kernels. This direction was discontinued, but code is still provided.
 - Code includes kernel segmentation, color property extraction, classification, and more.

Chemometrics
- Code developed to predict pericarp retention based on NIR spectra of data
- NIR spectra was collected with a FOSS Infratec NOVA, using the STM system with the cuvette pathlength set to 29mm.
