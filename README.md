# Pericarp Retention Analysis
### Michael Burns | UMN APS

## Background
Purpose: Developing methods for researchers to assess the quantity of pericarp retained after the nixtamalization process.

Current Direction: To better understand the association between rapid cook methods (Serna-Saldivar et al., 1991) and the benchtop cook test. After the association between cook tests is understood, assess biological aspects of kernels that underlie pericarp retention through chemometric and morphometric analyses.

## Directories
Chemometrics
- Code developed to understand biological relationship of kernel composition and shape with pericarp retention.
- NIR spectra was collected with a FOSS Infratec NOVA, using the STM system with the cuvette pathlength set to 29mm.
- Kernel shape/morphology was collected through image analysis or by hand (initial pericarp quantity, volume, mass, density)

Image Analysis
 - Code developed to assess images of stained kernels. This direction was discontinued, but code is still provided.
 - Code includes kernel segmentation, color property extraction, classification, and more.
